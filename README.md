# Clutch 

> **High Agency Emergency Finder. One click. We decide.**

Clutch is an AI-powered concierge designed for decision fatigue. Instead of scrolling through endless lists, Clutch uses the **Yelp AI Chat API** to find the perfect spot for you instantly. Whether it's a last-minute dinner, a pharmacy run, or finding a mechanic, Clutch handles the search and the booking intent.

## Key Features

### AI Concierge
Powered by the **Yelp Fusion AI API**, Clutch understands natural language queries and context. It doesn't just search; it recommends.

### Smart Booking Intent
Don't just find a place—book it. Clutch detects booking intent in your conversation.
*   *"Lets do 12pm"*
*   *"Book a table for 4"*
*   *"Schedule for 7:30"*
All these trigger the **Reservation Modal**, bypassing the API's limitation on direct bookings.

### Intelligent Location
*   **Auto-Detect**: Uses the browser's Geolocation API for instant results.
*   **Manual Override**: Easily switch to a specific city or zip code.
*   **Context Aware**: The AI knows where you are and filters results accordingly.

### Premium UI/UX
*   **Glassmorphism**: A modern, dark-mode aesthetic with frosted glass effects.
*   **Motion**: Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion.
*   **Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile for on-the-go emergencies.
